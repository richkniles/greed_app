	<h2>Greed Game Rules</h2>
	<p>Greed is a dice game played among 2 or more players, using 5
	six-sided dice.</p>

	<h3>Playing Greed</h3>

	<p>Each player takes a turn consisting of one or more rolls of the dice.
	On the first roll of the game, a player rolls all six dice which are
	scored by the following rules:</p>

	<div class = 'span12'>
		<div class = 'span4 offset1'>
			<h3>Scoring Dice</h3>
			<table class = 'table table-bordered table-condensed'>
			  <tr><td>Three 1's</td><td>1000 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>Three 6's</td><td>600 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>Three 5's</td><td>500 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>Three 4's</td><td>400 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>Three 3's</td><td>300 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>Three 2's</td><td>200 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>One   1  </td><td>100 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>One   5  </td><td> 50 points</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>four of a kind</td><td>Multiply triple score by 2</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>five of a kind</td><td>Multiply triple score by 4</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>six of a kind</td><td>Multiply triple score by 8</td></tr>
			</table>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p/>
	<p>A single die can only be counted once in each roll.  For example,
	a "5" can only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500
	points) or as a single 50 points, but not both in the same roll.</p>


	<div class = 'span12'>
		<div class = 'span3 offset1'>
			<h3>Example Scoring</h3>
			<table class = 'table table-bordered table-condensed'>
				<tr><th>Throw</th>       <th>Score</th></tr>
				<tr><td>5 1 3 4 1 4</td>   <td>50 + 2 * 100 = 250</td></tr>
				<tr><td>1 1 1 3 1 3</td>   <td>2 x 1000 </td></tr>
				<tr><td>2 4 4 5 4 3</td>   <td>400 + 50 = 450    </td></tr>
				<tr><td>1 1 1 1 1 1</td>   <td>8000!    </td></tr>
			</table>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p/>
	<p>The dice not contributing to the score are called the non-scoring
	dice.  "3" and "4" are non-scoring dice in the first example.  "3" is
	a non-scoring die in the second, and "2" and "3" are non-scoring dice in the
	final example.</p>

	<p>After scoring the roll, the dice contributing to the score (the scoring 
	dice) are set aside and the remaining dice can be thrown again. The player 
	can continue to roll the remaining non-scoring dice until he/she "stays", or
	until the thrown dice result in no score.  One exception to the rule of setting
	aside scoring dice is that if all thrown dice are scoring, 
	then all 6 can be thrown again. Also, if none of the thrown dice are scoring, 
	the player looses the turn as well as the accumulated score for the turn.  
	When a player who chooses to "stay", the throws for the turn are totaled and 
	added to his/her game score.</p>

	<p>The player may continue to roll as long as each roll scores points. If
	a roll has zero points, then the player loses not only their turn, but
	also accumulated score for that turn. If a player decides to stop
	rolling before rolling a zero-point roll, then the accumulated points
	for the turn are added to his/her total score.</p>

	<h3>Getting "In The Game"</h3>

	<p>Before a player is allowed to accumulate points, he/she must get at
	least 300 points in a single turn. Once a score of 300 points is achieved
	in a single turn, the points earned in that turn and each following
	turn will be counted toward the total score.</p>

	<h3>End Game</h3>

	<p>Once a player reaches 3000 (or more) points, the game enters the final
	round where each of the other players gets one more turn. The winner
	is the player with the highest score after the final round.</p>
